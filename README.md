# Mouth Design for rmbot

This repository showcases the design of a robot mouth that I created using the Shaper3D application.

## Description

The robot mouth design was created as a part of a larger project to develop a fully functional robot. The goal was to design an expressive can be used to enhance the robot's communication abilities and overall appearance.

The design was created using Shaper3D, a powerful 3D modeling and CAD software. The process involved several iterations to achieve the desired shape, size, and movement of the mouth.

## Features

- Detailed 3D model of the robot mouth
- Articulated design to allow for natural-looking movements
- Customizable size and shape to fit various robot designs
- Rendered images and animations to showcase the design

## Usage

To use this design, you can download the Shaper3D project file from the repository. This file can be opened in the Shaper3D application, where you can further customize the design or integrate it into your own robot project.

This column was designed to be able to move easily, and also from the inside, I put a base with this for work to stabilise the servo motor.

And this is it. The rule is to put a servo motor on it to control the movement easily
